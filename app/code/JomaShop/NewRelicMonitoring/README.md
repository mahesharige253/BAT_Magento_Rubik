# Magento 2 - Automatic GraphQL transaction naming for New Relic
New Relic's PHP agent has support for automatic transaction naming for REST and SOAP, but not GraphQL. Thus, this Magento 2 module is developed to support sending a GraphQL transaction name to New Relic automatically. 

## Details
A transaction is named based on the service class and method that handled the request, `/GraphQl/Controller/GraphQl\{operation name|(query|mutation)}\{name|Multiple}`.

The logic is explained as follows:
1. If the `operationName` field is set, use the operation name.
2. If the `operationName` field is not set, use the name of the query or mutation.
3. If a GraphQL query consists of multiple queries or mutations, the transaction would be indicated as 'Multiple'. Note that in any cases, the `operationName` field takes the priority.

## Installation
```
composer require jomashop/module-new-relic-monitoring-for-gql
```

## Examples

1. Operation name is set
```graphql
mutation createCustomerTest{
  createCustomer(
    input: {
      firstname: "Bob"
      lastname: "Loblaw"
      email: "test@example.com"
      password: "b0bl0bl@w"
      is_subscribed: true
    }
  ) {
    customer {
      firstname
      lastname
      email
      is_subscribed
    }
  }
}
```
In New Relic, the transaction name would be: `/GraphQl/Controller/GraphQl\Mutation\createCustomerTest`

2. Operation name is not set and only 1 query/mutation is requested
```graphql
mutation {
  createCustomer(
    input: {
      firstname: "Bob"
      lastname: "Loblaw"
      email: "test@example.com"
      password: "b0bl0bl@w"
      is_subscribed: true
    }
  ) {
    customer {
      firstname
      lastname
      email
      is_subscribed
    }
  }
}
```

In NR, the transaction name would be `/GraphQl/Controller/GraphQl\Mutation\createCustomer`

3. Operation name is not set and multiple queries/mutations are requested
```graphql
query {
  cmsBlocks(identifiers: "footer_links_block") {
    items {
      identifier
      title
      content
    }
  },
  storeConfig {
    id
    code
    website_id
    locale
    base_currency_code
    default_display_currency_code
    timezone
    weight_unit
    base_url
    base_link_url
    base_static_url
    base_media_url
    secure_base_url
    secure_base_link_url
    secure_base_static_url
    secure_base_media_url
    store_name
  }
}
```

In NR, the transaction name would be `/GraphQl/Controller/GraphQl\Query\Multiple`

## Change Log
- v1.1.1: Send requested fields as a custom parameter to NR
- v1.1.0: Able to log GraphQl errors
